      "First, let's understand what p and q are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition p is given by |4x - 3| ≤ 1. That looks like an absolute value inequality, which I think means that 4x - 3 is between -1 and 1. So, I can rewrite this as:\n",

      "To solve for x, I can add 3 to all parts of the inequality:\n",

      "-1 + 3 ≤ 4x ≤ 1 + 3\n",

      "\n",
      "So, condition p is true when x is between 0.5 and 1, inclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, condition q is given by the quadratic inequality:\n",
      "\n",
      "x² - (2a + 1)x + a² + a ≤ 0\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, okay. So, this is a quadratic in terms of x. Let me think about how to solve this inequality. First, I should probably factor it or find its roots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me write it down again:\n",
      "\n",
      "x² - (2a + 1)x + a² + a ≤ 0\n",
      "\n",
      "I can try factoring this quadratic. Let's see if it factors nicely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the coefficients: the coefficient of x² is 1, so it's monic. Let's check if it can be factored into (x - m)(x - n) where m and n are numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expanding (x - m)(x - n) gives x² - (m + n)x + mn. Comparing this to our quadratic:\n",
      "\n",
      "Coefficient of x: -(m + n) = -(2a + 1) => m + n = 2a + 1\n",
      "\n",
      "Constant term: mn = a² + a\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we need two numbers m and n such that their sum is 2a + 1 and their product is a² + a.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me see if I can express a² + a as a product of two terms. Hmm, a² + a = a(a + 1). So, maybe m and n are a and a + 1?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's check: m = a, n = a + 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, m + n = a + (a + 1) = 2a + 1, which matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "And mn = a(a + 1) = a² + a, which also matches.\n",

      "Great, so the quadratic factors as (x - a)(x - (a + 1)) ≤ 0.\n",

      "Therefore, the inequality becomes:\n",
      "\n",
      "(x - a)(x - (a + 1)) ≤ 0\n",
      "\n",
      "To solve this inequality, we can consider the critical points where each factor is zero, which are x = a and x = a + 1. Since the coefficient of x² is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards, so the inequality ≤ 0 will hold between the roots.\n",

      "\n",
      "a ≤ x ≤ a + 1\n",

      "So, condition q is true when x is between a and a + 1, inclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the problem states that p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for q. I need to interpret what that means.\n",
      "\n",
      "In logic, a necessary condition means that if q is true, then p must also be true. In other words, the solution set of q must be a subset of the solution set of p. Because if q is true, p must be true, but p being true doesn't necessarily mean q is true (since it's not sufficient, meaning the solution set of p isn't a subset of q's solution set).\n",

      "So, in terms of intervals:\n",
      "\n",
      "The interval [a, a + 1] must be entirely contained within [0.5, 1].\n",
      "\n",
      "But also, since p is not a sufficient condition for q, there must be some x in [0.5, 1] such that x is not in [a, a + 1]. So, the interval [a, a + 1] must be a proper subset of [0.5, 1], meaning that [a, a + 1] is entirely within [0.5, 1], but not covering the entire interval.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let's write down the conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. [a, a + 1] ⊆ [0.5, 1]\n",
      "2. [a, a + 1] ≠ [0.5, 1]\n",

      "\n",
      "From a + 1 ≤ 1 => a ≤ 0\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think again. Maybe I need to consider that the entire interval [a, a + 1] is within [0.5, 1]. So, the left endpoint a must be ≥ 0.5, and the right endpoint a + 1 must be ≤ 1. So, that gives:\n",

      "\n",
      "But that seems odd because the problem says to find the range of values for 'a', so there must be some solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Maybe the interval [a, a + 1] is entirely within [0.5, 1], so both endpoints must be within [0.5, 1]. So, a ≥ 0.5 and a + 1 ≤ 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But again, that would require a ≥ 0.5 and a ≤ 0, which is no solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the interval [a, a + 1] can be partially overlapping with [0.5, 1], but not entirely within it. But wait, no, because if p is necessary for q, then q implies p, so the solution set of q must be a subset of p's solution set.\n",
      "\n",
